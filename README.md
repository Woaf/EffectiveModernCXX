# Effective Modern C++ - Scott Meyers

## Repository description

This repo consists of illustrative code for the techniques introduced in the C++11 / C++14 standard explained in the book.

The notes written for each subsections are a lot less elaborate than what is written in the book. ***You should buy the book for greater details, and because its a good read for C++ developers.***

## Chapters

### **Item 7 - Item 17**

This chapter contains technologies that were introduced by C++11 and C++14.

### **Item 18 - Item 22**

Smart pointers (`std::unique_ptr`, `std::shared_ptr`, `std::weak_ptr`), implement PIMPL using smart pointers

### **Item 31 - Item 34**

This chapter explains how lambdas should be used, especially in C++14, and why `std::bind` should be avoided (after C++11).
